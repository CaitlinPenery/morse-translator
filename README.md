## Implementation

### MVP

-   Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
-   Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

    -   translate their English text into Morse Code
    -   Morse Code into English text

-   Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
-   Make sure to separate pure JS functions and DOM manipulation

-   Add unit testins for each of the pure function that your translator uses (each function should have at least 4 tests, think of edge case, wrong inputs, etc ...)

## Plan

1. HTML layout and CSS styling.
    - A text box for morse and english input/output.
2. JavaScript
    - Morse/English Object Array
    - DOM intergration
        - eventListener for Text Fields
    - Function to translate between Morse Code and English
3. JavaScript Testing
